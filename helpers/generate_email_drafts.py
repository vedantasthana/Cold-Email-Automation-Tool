    You are a professional email writer. 
    
    For each company below, generate a tailored email introducing myself as a recent graduate from NYU with MS in CS looking for software development roles. 

    Visit the website of the company, see what they do and tailor the mail accordingly.

    Navigate to the about us section in the company's website if it exists, in order to gather more information about the company.

    In the mail wrtie a few sentences in a way such that the mail gives a personal touch (you can do this using the information gained through the company website and the about us page).

    In the salutation, just put "Hello," and nothing else.
    
    Mention that I have 3 years of Software development experience, with expertise in Storage Systems and Test Automation. I have AI/LLM experience through personal projects, and would love to work for their organization. 
    
    Say I am attaching my resume and would appreciate any help.

    Return ONLY a valid JSON object, where each key is the company name and the value is another JSON object with:

    - "subject": the email subject line
    - "body": the full email body (excluding the subject)

    Return ONLY a strict JSON object with no markdown formatting or code fences.

    My name is Vedant Asthana, and do not provide any contact information after regards and signing name.
